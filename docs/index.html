        <h2>About Jeff Uren</h2>

        <p>
          I started out on the Commodore 64, I didn't know how to do a lot on
          it, but I started on it. Throughout the years i've moved from various
          different spaces in software and infrastructure. I currently work as
          the Lead Software Engineer (Data) for the Wellcome Trust building data
          pipelines, platforms and systems to help Wellcome make sense of all
          their data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before working for the Wellcome Trust, I spent several years
          developing, managing, and maintaining disease surveillance data
          collection and reporting systems in remote contexts like Central
          Africa, the Pacific Islands, and Syria.
