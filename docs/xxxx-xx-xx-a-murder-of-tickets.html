      <section>

        <p>
          About a year ago, my Dad, Mom, the kids, and I were crowded into my green crumby old Vauxhall Insignia
          that I call Bessie and just pulling out of the driveway to head down to Bristol to 
          Costco or Ikea or somewhere. About halfway backed out of the drive I stopped,
          shifted back into drive and parked the car stating very matter-of-factly: "We're not going anywhere."
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone was fairly confused, except for me. You see there are particular sounds that a
          machine makes when there's something wrong with it. They're not always loud.
          Sometimes it's a faint rattle, or a whine you only notice when things are quiet, a faint squeal 
          when your brakes are due a change. The sound I'd heard as 
          I started to turn the wheel to back out into the street was enough to make me decide to abort
          the trip we were about to take. And a quick look under the hood confirmed the suspicion I'd had, one of 
          the hydraulic lines for the cars power steering had blown and spewed hydraulic fluid all 
          across the engine compartment, pooling in the belly pan under the engine. At best, steering would
          have been exceptionally hard, at worst, the hydraulic fluid could have lit on fire and we could
          have found ourselves standing on the side of the motorway watching Bessie go up in flames.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one else had heard it, but  I drive that car every day, it has groans, creaks, whines and whistles.
          But I <strong>know</strong> those noises, I understand most of them and why they are there. When
          a new sound arrives, you can be damn well sure i'm going to see what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Danger, and problems arrive in a mechanical system seemingly at random but they always announce themselves
          fairly abruptly, and quite a lot of them are actually predictable. A bang, whistle, squeal. They generally 
          always have a cause, whether it's lack of maintenance, age, poor quality components, fatigue, or otherwise, 
          there's always an underlying cause. And if you know the machine well enough, you ride around in it enough, 
          you become acutely attuned to when those sounds change or new ones announce themselves.
          In IT, these problems announce themselves as a couple of different increasingly recurring phrases: "Just raise a ticket." "Why don't we just use X."
          "We're getting rid of Y."
        </p>

        <p>
          These phrases are the rattle, the whine, the squeal of a machine eating itself from
          within.
        </p>

        <p>
          A ticket, for example, is not a solution. It's a confession that we've arranged our
          technology in such a way that the people closest to the work don't have the right to touch the machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          And when people who have to ride in the machine can't adjust the chain, you don't get safety.
          What you end up with is resentment. You get workaround culture. You get shadow systems. Quiet duplication.
          You get that sinking feeling where empowerment should have been.

        <h2>The illusion of control</h2>

        <p>
          Most organisations don't choose friction on purpose. They choose <i>control</i> and friction
          comes along on the ride.
        </p>

        <p>
          It happens slowly. A department needs progress, so it asks for certainty. Certainty demands
          a plan. The plan demands governance. Governance demands approvals. Approvals
          demand artefacts. Artefacts demand process. Process demands a queue.
        </p>

        <p>
          The queue becomes a service desk. The service desk becomes "the technology function." And one 
          day nobody can quite remember how we managed to get to a place where changing a dropdown field 
          requires several meetings, vendor quotes, and a six month lead time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The business side gets agency over <i>how</i> technology is built because it pays for the project.
          The technology side loses agency over <i>how</i> technology is run because it's treated as a delivery 
          arm. Everyone is doing what makes sense <strong>locally</strong> and locally sensible actions have 
          great potential to create <i>globally absurd outcomes</i>.
        </p>


      </section>

        <h2>Self-service is not a luxury</h2>

        <p>
          A ticket is a symptom of something we refused to automate.
        </p>

        <p>
          If getting access takes days, people will share credentials.<br/>
          If techonology won't provision a tool within hours, people will provision it themselves.<br/>
          If security blocks people from certain plugins, they'll use an insecure machine.<br/>
          If publishing data takes committees, people will email spreadsheets.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>This isn't a moral failing. It's just. plain. physics.</p>

        <p>So the platform must make the <i>safe</i> thing the <i>fast</i> thing.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>standard access request flows with auditable automation</li>
          <li>one-click (or close) environments,</li>
          <li>default guardrails that run without negotiation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Security teams should love this, because the alternative is uncontrolled sprawl all
        dressed up as compliance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A quick side-note on quality</h2>

        <p>
          When people say "technology is complex,", they often mean something more precise without 
          really articulating it. What they really mean is: <i>the system fights back</i>. It resists change. It punishes curiosity.
          It makes the simplest things feel like they require permission from a distant authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          That resistance is not some natural law of computers. It's a signal about the <i>quality</i>
          of the relationship between people and their tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a healthy setup, quality has a discrete and very real "feel":
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li>You can see what you own</li>
          <li>You can change what you own</li>
          <li>You can measure whether you improved it</li>
          <li>You can undo mistakes without drama</li>
          <li>You can predict what will happen when you push a button</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When that "feel" disappears, the organisation compensates with <i>more process</i>. But process 
          is a poor substitute for quality. It's like wearing thick gloves because you don't trust
          your hands. You might avoid cuts, but ultimately you sacrifice the ability to be in touch with the system
          and the people working within and around its boundaries.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>The service desk is a gumption trap</h2>

        <p>
          There's a kind of fatigue that doesn't come from the work itself, it comes from the
          <i>obstacles around the work</i>. In mechanical terms, it's the moment you realize
          the bolt is stripped, the right tool is missing, and the manual assumes you already 
          know what it forgot to tell you. Your mind begins to bargain landing firmly on: "Maybe I don't need to fix this today."
        </p>

        <p>
          In organisations, those are gumption traps:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Fill in this form"</li>
          <li>"Wait for this committee"</li>
          <li>"We can't do that until next quarter"</li>
          <li>"That's not supported"</li>
          <li>"We'll need a new vendor"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The problem is not that controls exist. The problem is where those controls live.
        </p>

        <p>
          If controls live in documents and approvals, they become gates. Gates create
          queues. Queues create politics. Politics create and foster a culture of avoidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          If controls live in the engineering of the system through defaults, templates, 
          automated checks, and standard deployment paths, then they become guard-rails. Guardrails don't
          slow you down. They keep you from going over the edge while you move <strong>at a faster pace</strong>.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Where it goes wrong</h2>

        <p>
          No one is building technology estates anymore, they build technology <i>patchworks</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A patchwork happens when each new need is treated as a one-time exception:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>this team picks a tool</li>
          <li>that programme picks a vendor</li>
          <li>another group invents a workflow</li>
          <li>security is invited at the end to bless it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each decision is defensible on it's own, but together they form an intricate maze.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, then we wonder why integration is hard. Why reporting is brittle. Why upgrades are terrifying.
          Why nobody wants to touch old systems. Why technology feels like a department you <i>negotiate</i> with, 
          instead of a <i>capability</i> you <i>use</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the deepest issues here is one of <strong>decision rights</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you let business departments and programmes own the <i>how</i> it creates a broken culture. These
          people are geared to optimize for delivery on a timeline in their domains. Their incentives are not aligned to operability, 
          simplicity, or long-term cost. Not because they're wrong, or bad people, but because their focus is <i>different</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When these teams dictate the <i>how</i>, the organisation gets a pile of "done" systems that are not
          <i>finished</i>. They go live and then they linger, half-maintained, full of special cases, quietly demanding tribute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, the technology function is made to behave like a service counter:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>work comes in as tickets</li>
          <li>ownership is dispersed across queues</li>
          <li>decisions are escalated because nobody has the authority to decide</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          So we add more meetings to manage the escalations.
        </p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>A different arrangement: outcome vs. mechanics</h2>

        <p>
          If you want technology to stop feeling like friction, you have to rearrange who
          decides what.
        </p>

        <p>
          The business side should own:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>outcomes</li>
          <li>priorities</li>
          <li>and what success looks like</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Technology needs to own:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>architecture</li>
          <li>security implementation</li>
          <li>operational standards</li>
          <li>the mechanics of delivery and running</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is not a power grab. It's an alignment of responsibility along capability lines.
        </p>

        <p>
          The people who will be on the hook when something breaks must be allowed to design it so it
          <i>doesn't break</i>. If you separate responsibility from authority, you get brittle systems
          and very demoralized teams who are constantly in the crosshairs for the instability of systems they had no say 
          or control over. Ultimately <strong>if you don't carry the consequences, you shouldn't get to dictate the design</strong>. 
        </p>


      </section>

      <section>

        <h2>Paved roads, not heroic detours</h2>

        <p>
          The organisation doesn't need more freedom to pick tools. It needs more 
          freedom to ship and change <i>safely</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That freedom comes from paved roads: opinionated, well-maintained paths that
          make the right thing the easy thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          A paved road looks something like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>you start a service using a template</li>
          <li>it deploys using a standard pipeline</li>
          <li>it has logs, metrics, tracing by default</li>
          <li>it has security checks built in</li>
          <li>it has a clear interface contract</li>
          <li>it is observable, operable, and cost-visible from day one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When paved roads exist, teams stop reinventing foundations. Innovation moves up the stack.
          You get variety where it matters, and consistency where it saves your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without paved roads, every team takes a different route through the swamp, and then we 
          hold meetings about standardisation.
        </p>

      <h2>Funding: the quiet architect of chaos</h2>

      <p>
        Most dysfunction is funded into existence.
      </p>

      <p>
        If money arrives as a project budget and disappears at go-live, you get systems that 
        are built to <i>launch</i>, not to <i>live</i>. You get deferred maintenance as a 
        business model.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sustainability needs to be part of the investment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>running costs,</li>
        <li>reliability work,</li>
        <li>tech debt repayment,</li>
        <li>platform adoption effort,</li>
        <li>lifecycle ownership.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If we don't fund the care of the machine, we shouldn't be surprised when it starts to shake itself apart.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The temptation of consolidation</h2>

      <p>
        There's a certain kind of managerial serenity that comes from saying, "Let's just standardise on one platform."
      </p>

      <p>
        You can <i>feel</i> the relief in the sentence. The world becomes smaller. The software catalogue becomes 
          shorter. The procurement story becomes cleaner. The slide decks look like control.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then, quietly, the organisation begins to behave like a farm that's decided it will
        only ever grow one crop. At first the fields looks tidy. The rows are straight, tools are uniform,
        training is simplified, and support feels easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        But consolidation doesn't remove complexity. It <i>moves</i> it. It takes complexity that used to be 
        technical and distributes it into the organisation as <i>dependency</i>, <i>lock-in</i>, and <i>brittle constraints</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The danger of consolidation and monocultures is that they <i>feel like the responsible choice</i> right
        up until the moment they fail. And they fail <i>spectacularly</i>.
      </p>


    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When "less choice" becomes "less agency"</h2>

      <p>
        The naive assumption behind consolidation is fewer tools means less complexity. But as workers
        what we actually experience from day to day is not "tool count". It's the shape of our constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        A constrictive platform can simplify the first mile but <strong>punish every mile after</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the first integration is easy, the tenth is a compromise.</li>
        <li>the happy path is smooth, the real path becomes a workaround,</li>
        <li>the product demo is impressive, the edge cases become your lives work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The organisation adapts by bending itself around the platform. Instead of technology
        serving the work, the work serves the technology. And because the platform is "the standard,"
        the bending gets called "best practice."
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how you end up with a really strange inversion: the business feels it has reduced risk,
        while everyone else feels like they've lost the ability to make good choices. The organisation has
        traded <i>local</i> variation for <i>global</i> dependency, and dependency is not the same 
        thing as <i>simplicity</i>.
      </p>

      <h2>Diversity isn't chaos, it's resilience</h2>

      <p>
        When you think of "diversity of systems", you probably conjure up something akin to a junkyard in
        your mind. A loose smattering of different things all over the place, nothing doing everything all in one
        place. The human mind is endeared towards categorical, and neat, clean hierarchical structures formed into 
        strict patterns it can understand and reason about simply. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But diversity, done properly, isn't random variety. It's the same thing you can see in any
        healthy ecosystem: different species doing different jobs, and very few single points of failure
        that can wipe out the whole equilibrium.
      </p>

        <p>
          In a healthy, diverse ecosystem, evolution happens at the dynamic edge surrounded by change, and that
          change over time stratifies into layers of static quality. Diversification leads to innovation, exploration,
          growth and expansion. If you remove that leading edge of dynamism, static constraints never evolve, they calcify,
          and hinder the growth of your people, processes, operability and ultimately your organisation.
        </p>

      <p>
        In technology terms, diversity gives you:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the ability to choose the right tool for the job</li>
        <li>a hedge against vendor shifts and roadmap surprises</li>
        <li>the option to escape when something becomes unnafordable or ill-fitting</li>
        <li>real leverage in negotiation</li>
        <li>and perhaps most importantly: learning</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A monoculture turns learning into a vendor's training programme, it teaches you to be excellent
        at one product, but ultimately mediocre at handling change and solving the underlying problem 
          that you actually need to solve.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The risk consolidation quietly concentrates</h2>

      <p>
        Consolidation is often sold as risk reduction. Fewer suppliers, fewer contracts, fewer 
        moving parts. It has the clean feel of tidiness. But there's a marked difference between <i>tidy</i>
        and <i>safe</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you consolidate onto a small set of PaaS/SaaS vendors, you don't remove risk. You <i>compress</i> it.
        You take risks that used to be scattered and you stack them neatly in one place until that place 
        becomes a single, critical point of organisational failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of these risks are obvious if you look straight at them dead on, but some of them only 
        rear their ugly heads when they're bearing down on you in a crisis situation:
      </p>

      <h3>Systemic outage becomes an organisational outage</h3>

      <p>
        With a diverse estate, failures are local and recoverable. With a monoculture, a vendor 
        incident can stop whole classes of work at once. It's not just "an app is down." It's identity, access,
        data flows, reporting, workflows, and more. Everything that depended on that one pillar.
      </p>

      <h3>Price shocks and term changes stop being negotiable</h3>

      <p>
        Once your workfllows, skills, data, and integrations are built around one vendor's shape, you've thrown away your leverage.
        Renewal becomes a ritual where your strongest argument (i.e. "We can leave") is no longer credible. Costs creep,
        then jump. You pay because paying is <i>cheaper than escaping</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>Roadmap drift becomes your roadmap</h3>

      <p>
        Vendors build for their market, not for your edge cases. Features you depend on get 
        deprioritized. Interfaces change. Products get sunset. You're told it's progress, and sometimes
        it is but ultimately you don't get to choose the timing, and you don't get a say in whether it happens or not.
      </p>

      <h3>Data gravity turns into data captivity</h3>

      <p>
        The longer data lives inside a platform's services, the more expensive it becomes to move. Not 
        just in terms of bytes on disk expensive. Schemas, permissions, lineage, embedded logic, dashboards,
        automations. You don't just export data; you have to unpick an ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h3>Compliance becomes an external dependency</h3>

      <p>
        Controls you could once implement and prove internally become subject to a supplier's attestations, audit windows,
        and product limitations. You inherit their control boundaries. If they can't do what you need, your "governance" 
        becomes a request queue aimed at someone else's backlog.
      </p>

      <h3>Capability erosion makes recovery harder</h3>

      <p>
        The longer you rely on vendors to supply judgement, the less you practice it yourself. Then, when the platform
        stops fitting your organisation, whether through cost, constraint, or feature change, you suddenly discover 
        the most expensive risk of all: you no longer have the internal muscle to adapt quickly, or at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this is an argument against using vendors. It's an argument against <i>betting the organisation</i> on a small
        number of them without a layer of abstraction and a credible exit path.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mature posture isn't "we picked the right platform." It's: <strong>we can change platforms with little friction.</strong>
        This is what technical maturity and resilience looks like. Not a tidy catalogue but a machine whose critical paths can be replaced while the 
        machine is still running.

      <h2>The problem isn't actually consolidation, it's coupling</h2>

      <p>
        To be clear, not all standardisation is bad. Standardising the <i>boring</i> parts is often 
        the only sane way to scale. But the monoculture mistake happens when we standardise at
        the wrong layer, we standardise the <i>vendor</i> instead of standardising the <i>interface</i>.
      </p>


      <p>
        It's like deciding every bolt in every machine must come from one manufacturer, and then
        designing the whole workshop around whatever sizes that manufacturer happens to sell this year.
      </p>

      <p>
        The issue isn't that a platform exists. The issue is <strong>direct dependence</strong> on its quirks,
        constraints, and proprietary shape. This is what coupling is, and coupling is what makes change 
        expensive, arduous and painful.
      </p>

      <h2>The illusion of the triforce</h2>

      <p>
        When an organisation chooses a small set of "core platforms", it imagines a neat arrangement:
        each system with its own territory, each doing what it does best, all of them fitting together like
        well-made parts. This is illusory at best and doesn't reflect how these platforms actually behave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oracle, Salesforce, Azure/O365, Workday, and ServiceNow aren't content to be good at a single job. 
        They are built (by design, by market pressure, by quarterly incentives) to become "environments". To expand
        their borders. To offer "one more module" that promises to remove an integration, reduce a dependency, simplify
        a process. They don't just compete for spend. They compete for <i>centrality</i>, and that tension grows into 
          boundaries and points of contention between the teams which own, maintain, and utilize the platforms themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        So you end up with multiple systems, each quietly trying to become the operating system of the
        organisation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the very beginning it looks like progress. New features arrive. Bundles appear. The pitch is always the same: <i>stay inside
          our walls and life gets easier</i>. And for a while, on the happy path, it does. But overlap doesn't create
        harmony. It creates <strong>tension</strong>. Because there's no clean place to draw the borders when every tool
        is designed to <i>erase borders</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a very specific kind of confusion:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The same "trust" exists in more than one place</li>
        <li>The same workflow can be implemented in more than one platform</li>
        <li>The same identity and access questions get answered multiple different ways</li>
        <li>The same reporting need spawns parallel dashboards, parallel extracts, parallel definitions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And when it goes wrong, nobody can say where the system ends, because the system doesn't end. It bleeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where friction becomes a <i>moral</i> problem and is no longer a <i>technical</i> one.
      </p>

      <p>
        A person wants to do something simple: update a record, approve a request, change a form, generate a report. But the 
        request doesn't travel through one coherent machine. It travels through overlapping empires, each with its own
        logic, its own permissions, its own vocabulary for the same thing. The user experiences that overlap 
        as contradictions: "It says approved here but not there." "It exists in workday but not in Oracle." "Salesforce
        shows it differently." "The document is in O365 but the workflow is somewhere else."
      </p>

      <p>
        The knee-jerk reaction is to add more glue. We buy connectors. We commission integrations. We write policies. We build reconciliations and sync jobs
        and extracts and "single sources of truth" that are single in name only. The cost isn't just money. Every overlap actually
        demands a human somewhere to keep the seams from tearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the quiet trap of the monoculture: you think you're reducing complexity by limiting the number of platforms,
        but if the platforms overlap and each is trying to swallow more territory, you've actually created a different kind
        of complexity. <strong>Not many tools, but many claims of ownership over the same reality.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The deepest mistake is believing these systems will naturally resolve their borders for you, which they won't, because
        it doesn't align with their incentives: expansion.
      </p>

        <p>
          Large vendor platforms are like japanese knotweed, or zebra mussels. They arrive, they spread fast and crowd out native
          species, they rewire the entire ecosystem around themselves. Large vendor systems expand into adjacent "niches"
          (CRM -> analytics -> workflow -> identity), displacing local tools and practices until everything depends on them.
        </p>


      <p>
        Which means the organisation has to do what the vendors won't: decide what each platform is <i>for</i>, where it
        is allowed to be authoritative, and treat each system as an implementation detail behind concrete boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don't draw the lines, the platforms will draw them for you. And they'll draw them in the only place they can:
        <strong>around their own products</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately you'll wake up one day with a "simplified" estate that is paradoxically <i>harder to operate</i>. Primarily because
        you built the organisation inside of multiple competing definitions of reality, you'll name the resultant tension "integrations".
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Abstraction is the real antidote</h2>

      <p>
        If you want the freedom that consolidation promises, you don't get it by buying fewer things.
      </p>

      <p>
        You get it by <strong>layering.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        You build a thin, disciplined layer <i>above</i> your underlying systems and choices that 
        represents what your organisation actually is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>your concepts</li>
        <li>your data contracts</li>
        <li>your service boundaries</li>
        <li>your access model</li>
        <li>your workflows</li>
        <li>your operational standards</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That layer becomes your truth and the underlying systems become <i>implementations</i>. The great thing 
        about implementations, is that you can <i>replace them</i>. You can't replace truth.
      </p>

      <p>When the abstraction layer is strong:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>you can swap a SaaS without rewriting the organisation</li>
        <li>you can migrate gradually, not through a big-bang</li>
        <li>you can run two systems side-by-side during transitions</li>
        <li>you can keep your interfaces stable while internals evolve</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is what "future-proofing" actually looks like. Not betting everything on one vendor's roadmap,
        but making the vendor's roadmap <i>less relevant to your ability to operate</i>.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>From investing in people to renting someone else's judgement</h2>

      <p>
        A monoculture doesn't just standardise tools. It quietly annihilates <i>thinking</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When everything important is routed through a small set of platforms, the organisation stops
        building capability and starts buying it. Training becomes vendor certification. Expertise 
        becomes "who knows the admin console." Innovation becomes "what's on the roadmap." The craft
        shifts from understanding our own work to memorising someone else's product boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the money follows the attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of investing in people who can model our domain, design clean interfaces, automate controls,
        and improve systems over time, we invest in licenses, premium features, and consultants who translate 
        our needs into a vendor's vocabulary. The organisation becomes rich in subscriptions but ultimately, poor in judgement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trick is that this looks efficient because the spend is centralized and the story is easier to tell. But it's a brittle
        kind of efficiency: when the platform doesn't fit, we don't have the internal muscles to adapt, we just end up
        negotiating harder with the supplier, or even worse, contort ourselves to match the shape of the tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, the monoculture doesn't reduce complexity. It outsources it, then sends us the invoice. Generally,
        along with a quiet <i>erosion</i> of the one positive investment that actually consistently compounds over time: capable people who 
        can change the machine.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Vendors optimize for invoices</h2>

      <p>
        A vendor's relationship with your organisation has a clear centre of gravity: the contract. They are built
        to move work toward deliverables, milestones, and renewals. They are built to move work toward the point
        where value is declared and money changes hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        That doesn't make them evil but once you fully grasp and internalize it, what it does do is make them <strong>predictable</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vendors will sell you the future in confident language, then allocate you a team whose job is to get 
        to "done" in a way that is defensible on paper. They will prefer what scales for <i>them</i>: repeatable
        implementations, standard configurations, scope controls, and tidy sign-offs. The long tail of operability,
        edge cases, awkward integrations, and the messy reality of how your organisation actually works arrive much, 
        much later, usually after the hard part of their incentive has been satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Believing a vendor is "invested in our organisation" is naive in the same way it's naive to believe
        a GPS is invested in your journey. It will give directions but it will not carry the consequences. When the route
        is wrong for the road you're on, you're the one who pays in time, money, workarounds, and lost agency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real investment looks like ownership, continuity, and accountability when things are hard. Vendors can 
        support that, but they cannot replace it. If we want technology to serve us, we need to keep the 
        responsibility (and ultimately the power) to adapt the machine, inside the organisation.
      </p>

      <h2>The difference between "platform strategy" and "vendor strategy"</h2>

      <p>
        A platform strategy says:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"We will make common things easy and safe"</li>
        <li>"We will publish golden paths"</li>
        <li>"We will standardise interfaces and operational patterns."</li>
        <li>"We will enable teams to deliver outcomes with minimal friction."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A vendor strategy says:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"We will purchase a box and then live inside of it"</li>
        <li>"We will align our work to its feature set"</li>
        <li>"We will call constraints 'governance'"</li>
        <li>"We will treat migration as a rare, traumatic event."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Vendor strategy is attractive because it looks like a decision you can make once, but technology
        is not a decision you make once, it's a relationship that you have to live in.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The quiet cost</h2>

      <p>
        When everything routes through one or a limited set of constrictive platforms, the organisation
        pays in subtle ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>"platform experts" become gatekeepers</li>
        <li>costs rise and you can't credibly threaten to leave</li>
        <li>changes become negotiations with the vendor rather than engineering work</li>
        <li>workarounds accumulate until the "standard" becomes the messiest system of all</li>
        <li>and innovation beccomes the art of fitting new needs into old shapes</li>
      </ul>


      <p>
        A monoculture creates a new kind of bureaucracy: not internal, but outsourced. And outsourced
        bureaucracy is still just bureaucracy except now it comes with subscription fees and longer lead-times.
      </p>


    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What we should do instead</h2>

      <p>
        Keep a bias toward standardisation, but standardise the <i>right thing</i>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Standardize <i>abstractions</i> (UIs, business processes, self-service)</li>
        <li>Standardise <i>interfaces</i> (contracts, schemas, APIs, event types)</li>
        <li>Standardize <i>operational patterns</i> (deploy, observe, secure, recover)</li>
        <li>Standardise <i>access and governance primitives</i> (identity, policy, audit)</li>
        <li>Standardise <i>golden paths</i> (how teams build and run common workload types)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And keep diversity where it buys real value:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Allow multiple implementations behind stable contracts and user experiences</li>
        <li>Prefer portable technologies where feasible</li>
        <li>Design migrations as normal, incremental activity and not as existential events</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you do this well, you get the benefits people want from consolidation like lower friction, easier onboarding,
        and repeatable operations, all without the naive dependency that turns "standard" into "cage". Because ultimately
        the goal isn't really to own fewer tools, it's to be free to change those tools without the organisation
        going into a screaming, rage-induced panic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Closing</h2>

      <p>
        It's tempting to close this with a call for consolidation, a new committee, maybe a stricter process. That's the 
        familiar ritual: when complexity hurts, add more structure. But we've already seen where that road ends up, multiple times over. 
        You don't cure friction by building a larger machine around the friction. And ultimately it's extremely naive to believe
          that it's a failure of a teams function when it's hands are tied behind it's back across most decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cure is ultimately both <i>simpler</i>, and <i>harder</i>: restore the right kind of <i>agency</i>, then build the right kind of <i>constraints</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agency means the people accountable for running the systems have the authority to shape them. Constraints mean
        we stop improvising foundations and start paving roads with abstractions that have sane defaults that carry security, operability,
        and consistency without requiring permission slips for every change.
      </p>

      <p>
        And above all, we stop mistaking vendor uniformity and consolidation for organisational simplicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a comforting myth that complexity is the price of sophistication. But much of what
        we call sophistication is merely the accumulation of unexamined exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quality, in the practical sense, is when the system invites care. When it can be 
        adjusted without ceremony. When the people closest to the work can improve the work
        without pleading with a queue.
      </p>


      <p>
        A technology monoculture promises calm. What it actually delivers is dependence. The way out isn't to own
        fewer tools. It's to own our <i>abstractions</i>, <i>interfaces</i>, <i>contracts</i>, and <i>operational patterns</i>. 
        The thin but powerful layer of truth that makes tools <strong>replaceable</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When that layer exists, technology stops being a negotiation and becomes a practice again. Teams can 
        move without ceremony. Change becomes normal. Migration becomes incremental. The organisation regains the most 
        practical kind of confidence. Not confidence that you picked the perfect platform, but the confidence that 
        you can change your mind when reality proves that it wasn't perfect after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's the real measure of maturity, not how tidy the software catalogue looks, but how easily we 
        can adjust and change it while we're still sitting behind the steering wheel.
