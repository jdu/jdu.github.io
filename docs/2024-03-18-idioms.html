      <h1>Idioms</h1>

          This is basically an evolving collection of idioms, principles, and
          laws that I'm collecting up and parsing through to come up with some
          concrete things to keep in the back of my head when engineering
          solutions.

              Write the simplest thing that could possibly work first. Complex
              algorithms might be faster in the limit, but often the limit is
              never approached. Code clarity is almost always more important tha
              that last 2% of performance.

            <p>
              Don't re-invent the wheel. This is especially true of
              infrastructure. Use what the OS gives you.

              Like seatbelts, you want a type system to fit snugly but not
              painfully.

              If a tool has more options or features than I can easily remember,
              it means those options effectively don't exist.

              Be welcoming and friendly. No matter who much you think you made
              it all on your own, it took a cast of thousands.

          <p>
            "Just" is suggesting a solution someone might not have seriously
            considered. "Just" suggests to get something done without spending
            your time over-engineering or exaggerating it. Nike's famous "Just
            do it." is a great example - just do it. don't overthink it, don't
            make excuses, do the thing you want to do. If someone's telling you
            to "just x" they think you have the capacity and ability to get x
            done. If they didn't, they'd elaborate.

            A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from
            a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to
            be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and
            cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a
            working simple system.
