<div class="paragraph">
<p>I grew up in a small town in Northern Ontario, Canada. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find it on a map. It&#8217;s one of those places where you can still subsist on the land (to an extent) and what nature provides, within reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s the type of place where kids grew up losing friends to the hard edges of nature, the type of accidents you only really hear about elsewhere in movies and TV shows, were if not common-places, at least had a high probability of potentially happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These types of places breed a different type of people, with wholly different sensibilities. I&#8217;ve been confronted with that fact for most of my adult life through interactions with other people, exposure to other cultures, and travelling abroad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was around 15 years old I fell through the ice, it was late at night, overcast, and one of the fastest ways to get to and from town in the dead of Winter was to use your snowmobile to ride across the frozen lakes and trails to get wherever it was that you were heading. On this specific night, I was heading home from the movies and a bit of a late night in a coffee shop, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee with friends. By the time I left to go home, it was dark, overcast, and I was losing the light very rapidly. By the time I hit the lakes I had lost what little light had been left to me and I found myself without bearings deep in the Northern Ontario wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Panic hadn&#8217;t kicked in yet, or maybe it had and I just refused to accept it. I had been riding for about a half hour and had clearly taken a wrong turn somewhere, I was on the lakes, but there were no lights on the shores, there were no docks or clearly lit windows of houses along the shoreline as far as I could see. The softly drifting snow, like rain, forms layers and layers of haze that play tricks on the eyes in the dark as your eyes fight to focus on the far off distance but are continually dragged back to the sheets of falling snow in the beam of your headlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to try and get a bit of a better idea of where I was, to try and find some bearings, some landmark that I could recognize, whether it was the bend of a turn in the lake, a point I had passed many times before, an island, anything, I stopped my snow machine, turned off the lights and walked out away from it. The main idea being that my eyes were struggling because of the light from the headlights on the machine, so if I stepped away and let my eyes adjust I might just be able to make something out that I recognize through the murky white soup that was fogging my vision.</p>
</div>
<img src="/images/snow_machine.png"/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was just as my pupils were adjusting that I went straight through the ice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever lived anywhere cold like Northern Ontario, you know you can dress for -30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, you can generally be pretty comfortable if you pay attention to appropriate layering, covering exposed skin, etc&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All those layers, sopping wet in near frozen water are nothing more than a recipe for death.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I was falling I had managed to twist just enough to catch the lip of the hole I had created under my one arm. The last ditch move hadn&#8217;t saved me from a thorough dunking, but it had kept me from going under and getting suck under the ice, or sinking like a lead balloon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I managed to slowly drag myself up onto the ice from out of the hole, the heavy leathers I was wearing weighed as much as a whole other person. I was panting while I hoped that the ice I was balancing on wouldn&#8217;t give way under me as I wasn&#8217;t sure that I had it left in me to get back out again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few feet away from the hole I gambled on making it to my snow machine, limping along in my slush-filled, fast-freezing gear. I could hear the leathers around my knees and arms cracking as the water turned to ice in the cold air and my movement broke some of it free. My hand landed on the bar across the back of the track of the snow-machine, thankfully still running and I hauled the backend of the snow-machine 90 degrees to point it away from where I had fallen through, hopped on, and gunned it to get away from there as quickly as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My entire tact changed from "get home" to "get anywhere" in the span of less than a minute. My eyes scanned the horizon for any sign of a house-light, any sign of a road, an opening in the tree-line that might be hiding a house set back from the shoreline that I could find safety in, but there was nothing. To distract myself a bit from the situation I was letting off a constant litany of swear words into the inside of my helmet. But it wasn&#8217;t enough to distract me from the fact my feet were starting to lose sensation, they&#8217;d made the slow insidious crawl from the cold sting of wet socks to a dull numb-ness that was trying to trigger panic in my brain, I was desperate to ignore it and keep the adrenaline pumping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The moment I saw the vague far off incandescent light I nearly lost my mind. The cold was working its way up my legs, and my teeth were chattering uncontrollably in my head, my jaw was in pain from trying to dampen the chattering, and it felt like someone had wound my jaw with rubber bands in every direction for all the good it did me trying to get keep my teeth from rattling out of my head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I made it to shore, drove straight up to the door that the light sat above, and hammered on the door. I was in tears, everything hurt, it had been almost an hour since I had fallen through the ice. I was mentally preparing myself to break into the house if no one answered when the door swung open and light flooded out onto the patch of packed driveway snow I was occupying. I can&#8217;t even imagine what I looked like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All I could muster to say through my chattering teeth was something along the lines of "I fell through, I can&#8217;t feel my feet".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My memory is pretty hazy after that point, once I had made it through the doo, my body must have swapped out the last reserves of adrenaline I had been running on in order to settle into an acute case of shock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My data picked up in his Silverado, but I don&#8217;t remember how long it was before I got there and when he arrived. There must have been a considerable amount of time, but it&#8217;s all a blur. I know he was upset, but I don&#8217;t remember words, nor do I remember the car journey home, or how long it took. I didn&#8217;t even know whose house I had actually ended up at.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this day I still have periodic nightmares about standing in the middle of a frozen lake, the only thing I can see, the hazy outline of the tips of the pines off in the distance along the edge of where they met the dark night sky. All else is black, other than the small area around me. The only sound the crunching of the snow under my boots and the dull thump and crackle of ice settling in the dark of night. I&#8217;m paralyzed with fear, and scared to run in any direction in case I fall through. So I stand stock still, hoping for the moon, or stars to break out and give me a path home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll close by saying that I feel an immense amount of guilt for what that experience must have been for my parents. Living in Northern Ontario or any remote Northern Community in Canada comes with a marked acceptance that these things <strong>could</strong> and <strong>will</strong> happen. It&#8217;s unfortunately inevitable. I was far from the first to go through the ice, but I was one of the lucky ones that didn&#8217;t lose their life because of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the home that I had ended up at that night, they hadn&#8217;t been so lucky with their own son years before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here I was standing on their doorstep in the middle of the night, drenched and frozen, in bad shape. I feel an unending well of guilt for the horror show of emotions they must have had to relive because of my carelessness. My poor decision to leave it so late getting home. I&#8217;ll forever be indebted to them, least of which for leaving that porch light on, for taking me in, calling my parents. There&#8217;s not much else I could possibly say really that would explain how much gratitude I feel to those people, and how bad I feel for what I must have inflicted on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was far from the only time that I nearly died in Northern Ontario, or at least came close to doing myself permanent bodily harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My dad went back for the snow machine the next day, and he tried to find where I had gone through, but he couldn&#8217;t find a trace of where I&#8217;d been or where I had come from, or how I had strayed so far from the trail home. The falling snow had covered over my tracks, and if my father couldn&#8217;t find it in broad daylight, if I hadn&#8217;t had caught my arm, it&#8217;s likely they wouldn&#8217;t have found whatever was left of me until the next Spring.</p>
