          Just to give you some background, I’ve worked from home / remotely for
          the last 10+ years, in that time I’ve moved from Canada to England and
          currently live and work from a remote farm out in the “boonies” in
          Gloucestershire.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no silver bullet to being a productive worker at home, for a
          lot of people it’s going to be an intensely personal configuration of
          things that leads you to being able to work from home and ultimately
          becoming productive from home. I can’t stress enough that for some
          people it’s going to be hard, it’s a large adjustment, but remember
          that everyone will be going through it at the same time, make sure
          that you have friends, family and co-workers that you can lean on
          during this period to help you keep yourself sane and healthy during
          what is going to be a trying period for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working from is going to take a level of self-awareness that you may
          not have had to deal with in the past, learning to read yourself and
          picking apart what’s causing you to feel lethargic, out of it,
          unproductive is going to be a large part of your life for the first
          little while, and you’re going to need to adjust how you do things as
          time goes by and your working environment changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing below is a silver bullet, and if you have your own tips or
          tricks, it would be really good to see them in the comments below.
          Multiple team members in Wellcomes Digital and Data Labs teams
          contributed to the list below, thank you to everyone for your
          contributions!

        <h2>Don't Overinflate Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          You’re at home, you have no distractions (or limited distractions),
          you have nowhere you need to be, so you should be 1 million times more
          productive than being in an office right? That’s what Jason Fried told
          everyone isn’t it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower your expectations for yourself, working from home is like
          learning any other skill and it’s rare that someone can jump into it
          and even be remotely as productive as they previously were working
          from an office. Give yourself room to breathe and observe and
          understand the things that distract you, the things that are getting
          in the way of you feeling productive and focus on mitigating or
          limiting (or embracing!) those things to start so that you can feel
          comfortable at home, on your own, working by yourself.

        <h2>Track things</h2>

        <p>
          To help create some structure, I recommend you try either Bullet
          Journaling or the Pomodoro Technique to help you focus, but also to
          make sure that you’re being realistic about what you can accomplish
          and how you use your time. If you’re a dev and you’re more comfortable
          in the command-line try out TaskWarrior. Make a routine of sitting
          down at your desk in the morning and reviewing your bullets, task
          list, etc… and really objectively thinking about what you can get done
          in the time you’ve got… then only try and achieve half of that.
          Anything you do over and above that is a bonus!

        <h2>Structure</h2>

        <p>
          To start at least, keep your same routine as if you were going to the
          office, get up, do the things you would normally do. There’s going to
          be a gap where you would have been travelling to the office, use that
          time to your benefit. Watch an episode of a show, go for a walk, read
          for a while to clear your head before you start into it, resist the
          urge to go and sit at your computer and start working. You need a
          baseline to start from that you can then try and figure out the best
          flow of your day that works for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get dressed as if you were going to work, it helps you to separate
          your work time and home time mentally.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Early / Night Birds</h2>

        <p>
          There’s inevitably going to be people online and doing things
          early/late. Ignore them, most likely they’ve got a deadline, or
          they’ve forgot to close slack, whatever it is don’t let yourself fall
          into the same patterns just because you see others doing it. Don’t
          model your behaviours on what you perceive others are doing in their
          WFH time, as they may just be figuring out what works best for them,
          and there are some people who may be on different time zones.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Stop when you need to stop</h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely resist the urge to work through lunch, or put in that extra
          30 minutes at the end of the day because the kids aren’t home yet, or
          sitting down at your desk 30 minutes early because the kids are
          already off to school, etc… Just get up from your desk, and walk away.
          It’s a slippery slope where you start to justify that extra half hour,
          but the truth is you’re probably not being very productive and walking
          away would be a better choice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Don't eat breakfast / lunch / dinner at your desk</h2>

        <p>
          Get up, go make yourself a sandwich, eat in a different room from the
          computer, go outside, whatever, just don’t sit at your computer and
          eat, you need to break up your day and you need to step away from the
          computer and stretch your legs and get blood flowing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Exercise</h2>

        <p>
          I have a weight bench, bars and dumbbells behind my desk and I go out
          and chop wood fairly often as a break. You need to do something. Sign
          up for Les Mills online, a yoga app, or some other online service and
          at lunch do a 20 minute workout, go for a walk, run on the spot, do
          sprints. You’re not going to be moving around as much as you were in
          the office, so your baseline physical activity will have dropped
          significantly working from home.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Celebrate your achievements</h2>
        <p>
          If you manage to do something, complete something, pony up and tell
          people on slack, Teams, wherever. Likewise, if someone achieves
          something and posts it up on Slack, Teams, etc… celebrate it and
          congratulate them. Then get up, go get yourself a cookie, coffee or
          treat and carry on.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Nominate a Rubber Duck</h2>

        <p>
          Once a week, in your team, nominate someone as the rubber duck for the
          day. It’s that person’s job to take calls from other team members and
          listen to them explain work problems they’re working through and just
          be an ear.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Don't blame the toaster</h2>

        <p>
          You might end up tending towards viewing things in your home in an
          adversarial way. For instance, you’ll start looking at your TV as the
          enemy of productivity. Try to avoid that line of thinking, it leads
          you down a path where you just become angry at your possessions and
          their potential to ruin your productivity and it can eventually
          trickle over into how you deal with other people as well.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Do things you couldn't do in an office (within reason)</h2>

        <p>
          Don’t treat it as a jail sentence, find the things that you enjoy that
          you can now do at home with impunity while you work. Celebrate those
          things. I can get up any time I want and wander into the living room
          and play a game of cards with my son, or call up a friend and chat
          while I work. Buy a really noisy clicky keyboard
          (https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/UNI0P4A). Or you can crank
          Journeys Don’t Stop Believing and sing it at the top of your lungs in
          the middle of the day, I don’t do that though, never.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Background noise</h2>

        <p>
          Some of us absolutely cannot work with background noise, some of us
          absolutely cannot work without it. There are loads of ASMR and
          environmental sound playlists on Spotify which you can fire up to
          provide some white noise or background noise to give you a feeling
          like things are going on around you. Another good one is oddly video
          game soundtracks and the LoFi playlists on Spotify, no lyrics, just
          calm, smooth background music to work to.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I do on occasion (usually when I get sick of music) is stick on a
          TV series in the background that I have watched before, it’s less
          distracting but also comforting because you know what’s going to
          happen next, so it doesn’t draw your your focus. Over the years I
          reckon I’ve played through all the seasons of Futurama about 40 times
          doing this and I’ve been sat at my desk and realized a season has
          ended and I didn’t tune into a single part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="">LoFi Hip Hop Music</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          See if there already is a chat group, slack channel or otherwise
          dedicated to work music at your org, if there isn’t, create one and
          start sharing your WFH playlists.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Avoid podcasts if they distract you</h2>

        <p>
          News-heavy, new content is going to distract you, as nice as it is to
          hear people talking, it has the ability to tear your focus completely
          away from work and you can quickly get frustrated not realizing that
          what you’re listening to is the root of the problem.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Try pairing a few times</h2>

        <p>
          Pick a buddy for an afternoon, install Discord, and stay persistently
          on Discord with them or your team so you can strike up audio
          conversations at will and feel like you’re interacting more. Hearing
          other people socialize even if you’re not interacting will help with
          the isolation.
        </p>

        <p>https://discordapp.com/</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Schedule all-hands meetings</h2>

        <p>
          Set aside a time each week for your team to just have a call. No
          topic, no agenda, just jump on a call with the people in your team and
          chat about whatever is on people’s minds. You do this in the office
          constantly, you have passing conversations with people constantly,
          whether it’s a polite hello and chit-chat to the staff at Wellcomes
          doors, or a quick convo on the elevator on the way up to your floor.
          That isn’t going to happen anymore, and you need that social
          interaction so create time and space for it to happen.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Buy healthy snacks</h2>

        <p>
          I tend to munch a lot when I’m working from home. Buy / order some
          healthy snacks to munch on. There are loads of bulk things like nuts,
          dried fruit, granola, etc… that you can buy on sites like Amazon that
          will save you making loads of trips to the kitchen throughout the day.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Shut off the world</h2>

        <p>
          People make a lot of noise about office environments being
          distracting, etc… But in truth, digital things can be just as
          disruptive if not more so. If you feel like you’re getting easily
          distracted by team chats like Slack or Teams or even email. Turn it
          off, close them, even go so far as disabling the wifi on your
          computer. Take the morning off from the internet and just work, and
          then sign back in at lunch and review what you missed. If something is
          so unbelievably important that they need your answer to it
          immediately, people can call or text you. Make sure you tell people
          you’re doing this though, so they don’t worry about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have trouble with self-discipline when it comes to certain
          sites like Facebook or Twitter, try an app like Cold Turkey
          https://getcoldturkey.com/ to block those sites on your computer until
          out of office hours times.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Communicate with partners / roommates</h2>

        <p>
          Don’t get angry if you get interrupted by your family/roommates. Give
          them a heads up when you’re going to need some heads-down
          uninterrupted time to focus or when you’re going to be on calls so
          that they don’t inadvertently stress you out or do something you feel
          is disrupting you. If they are doing something that’s disrupting you,
          talk to them, communicate it and don’t silently sit and fume about it
          and let it ruin your day.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Be patient</h2>

        <p>
          This is a fairly big one. If you have family that’s normally at home
          during the day, or your partner or children are going to be at home
          with you. Remember, this is a major adjustment for them as well,
          they’re probably not used to you being around all the time either and
          it might take them a while to adjust to your constant presence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Kids</h2>

        <p>
          If you’ve got kids like I do, and you’re worried about how things are
          going to go with you at home and them at home, and this whole work
          thing. Don’t stress about it too much, accept the distraction of
          having random conversations or cwtches. Treat it as a new job perk and
          not an impediment to getting things done.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your kids are old enough, spend the next couple weeks communicating
          to them that you are now entering work time and that you need them to
          let you get on and that you will come and play with them at your
          break/lunch/after work. And go play with them at your break. It’s not
          going to magically make them leave you alone right away, but if you
          keep at it, they’ll start to get accustomed to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make a sign with your kids that you can hang on the door saying “Shop
          Open” on one side and “Shop closed” on the other, so your kids
          understand when they can and can’t come in to see you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have to do things like collect children from school at the same
          time every day consider blocking that out in your diary otherwise
          someone will book an important meeting at 3pm which you can’t make.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Don't make your desk/workspace too important</h2>

        <p>
          There’s an article by Stephen King, where he talks about when he first
          started to make money, how he bought a big solid desk, and put it in
          the center of a dedicated office for him to work in. Years later he
          moved his desk to a small one in the corner and put in a TV and couch
          so he could sit and watch the game with his kids while he figured out
          what he was doing. His work desk is probably smaller than what we have
          in the office.
        </p>

        <p>
          The point being, don’t rely on a space and things to make you
          magically productive. There’s no difference fundamentally between a
          giant mahogany desk with a £500 Herman Miller desk chair and your
          kitchen table other than the former creates an unrealistic expectation
          that magic is going to happen the moment you sit down at it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Accept Low Productivity and Adjust Accordingly</h2>

        <p>
          You are going to have days where it just isn’t working for you. The
          kids might be all over you, the noise outside might be driving you
          nuts. On days like that what I like to do is separate my tasks into
          two sets 1) Things that are really hard problem solving issues and 2)
          Things that require you to think, but are short to complete, don’t
          require a lot of set up and will give you a sense of accomplishment in
          a short period of time. Work through the items in bucket 2 until you
          feel like you can tackle an item from bucket 1.

        <h2>People are visual</h2>

        <p>
          If you have apps or tools that let you diagram and draw things, use
          them to help you communicate concepts. I have a an old wacom drawing
          tablet and AutoDesk Sketchbook (it’s a free drawing application) which
          I might bring out of retirement and start using. If you have the
          ability to create quick, ad-hoc visuals to support your communication,
          do it if you think it will help.

        <h2>Use video on calls</h2>

        <p>
          I know you want to sit in your pyjamas while your work, but try to
          make yourself presentable and have video on during calls, using only
          audio means you may miss out on visual cues in understanding other
          people on the call, and it generally gives everyone a better feeling
          if they can see who they’re talking to versus a blank/black screen.

          There won’t be visual cues of people getting up and going for lunch,
          talking more, etc… going on around you. If you need the extra
          structure, set an alarm on your phone for lunch and end of day so you
          have something to pull you out of any deep work and remind yourself to
          call it a day.

          If you find yourself staring at the screen unable to really get
          moving, pop open a text editor (Notes on macos for example) and just
          start writing. Write anything, it doesn’t matter what it is, write a
          poem about what you’re working on today, your gricery list, a bucket
          list of things to do, random gibberish, a short story, it doesn’t
          matter. Just get your fingers moving and things pouring out of your
          head to clear the slate. You can do this for up as long as you need
          but I find after 15 minutes of I feel a bit more ready to tackle some
          actual problems.

            Don’t work from the couch, or bean bags, it will come back to haunt
            your back.

            Put a big jug of water on your desk in the morning, you WILL forget
            to hydrate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ping your co-workers regularly, share funny links, tell jokes, just
            interact, it will help others adjust as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not everything needs to be a video chat / call, share a document and
            collab via chat, don’t drag others into a meeting unless there’s an
            absolute necessity for it.
          </li>

            It can help to leave the house once you’ve finished for the day,
            even for just a few minutes to mark the end and disconnect yourself
            from work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write and speak more in-depth than you normally would, there won’t
            be visual cues during conversation for people to pick up on, so
            overcommunicating in some situations might be key to getting a point
            across.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a mac and an iPad, you can set up your iPad as an extra
            external monitor.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a smart TV kicking around, or even an old TV kicking
            around, you can configure that as a secondary monitor.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a Samsung Fridge, I guess you might be able to configure
            it as a secondary monitor…

            Your food bill is probably going to go up, watch your intake, eat
            light meals to avoid the mid-afternoon slump you get from carb-heavy
            recipes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try not to listen to new music (with lyrics), it will inevitably
            draw your attention away, build a playlist of songs you know and try
            to stick to those during work hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check to see if your organisation has any rebates, perks for
            internet or 3g/4g dongles so you can work from more than home,
            places like the park, etc… to get some fresh air.
