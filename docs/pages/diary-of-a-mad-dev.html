<p>For a number of years I worked tirelessly on a project called EWARS (and later Sonoma, and then Oana) that amalgamated a data collection, reporting, analysis, mapping, and a whole ot of other components for the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point i&#8217;ll do a more formal write-up about that project, but, having bought a scanner to do work on the illustrations for other posts (and a book; dun-dun-dunnn) I figured i&#8217;d allocate some time to scanning in <strong>a lot</strong> of old drawings, diagrams, designs, notes and other ephemera from the years that I worked on this project.</p>

<p>The images below span a period of about 6 years, across about 20 notebooks. It&#8217;s not exhaustive, nor in chronological order. More than anything it&#8217;s a peek into the life of a one-man show development project, and maybe a testament to what you can actually accomplish given time, space, freedom and a hard work ethic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system that this content revolves around is still in use across somewhere between 20-30 countries spanning the Pacific, Middle-East, Africa and more. My time ont he project ended around 2017, and somewhat at a loose end I tried to figure out if I could take the projects code and turn it into something bigger.</p>
