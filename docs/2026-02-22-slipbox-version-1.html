        I hate note-taking apps, note-taking and todo apps. I hate them.
        <strong>So. Much.</strong>
      </p>

          I've been using computer for a long time. My first computer was a
          Commodore 64 with a bootleg copy of
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)"

          and all the jumpman games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before that, every day after school I would wander over from my
          primary school to my Moms office across the street and sit at her
          IBM-style PC and play a math tutoring game that to this day I haven't
          figured out the title of, and Where in the world is Carmen San Diego.

        <h2>Missing Bits</h2>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            Why does no one talk about the difference between early moleskines
            and what we get now in the shops? At some point they changed the
            paper drastically and it's never really been quite the same.
          </span>
          I didn't use computers really for note-taking or anything approaching
          time management until I was in my late 20s. And even then, I still
          mostly kept a moleskine (when the paper was still high quality) and a
          nice pen. I vaguely remember buying alot of a specific yellow legal
          pad type that I really liked the feel of writing on. The only thing
          that's come close since is the extremely expensive Mnemosyne notebooks
          and pads i've become slightly addicted to.
        </p>

        <p>
          All this is to say, I fucking hate note software and todo apps. I'm
          not even going to wade into the cesspool that is project management
          and issue trackers, because that's just a whole other level of angry I
          don't want to explore right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oh I bet you've never tried..." <strong>Shush</strong>. I have, i've
          tried them all, across Windows, Mac, Linux, Terminal, Web, paid, free,
          FOSS, embedded in other IDEs, emacs-based, vim-based. All of them.
          They're all the same form of terrible to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I need to qualify that a bit better. They're all shit
          <strong>for me</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not telling you to not use them. They may be perfect for you, and
          for what you want them for. For me, my relationship with knowledge
          software has been nothing less than hostile and that's probably more
          of a failing or abherration in me than it is a problem with these
          pieces of software.

        <h2>Brainy bits</h2>

        <p>
          The miasma that is my brain, for whatever reason, does not take well
          to the general concept of a piece of software that I input my
          thoughts, ideas, observations, goals, and emotional state into. As
          much as I love computers and software engineering, that part of me
          that wants to record, research, and discover, feels repressed whether
          i'm typing into logseq, roam, OneNote, or writing in Apple Notes with
          a pen, or logging tasks in TaskWarrior, omnifocus or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>I feel robbed of something when I use these applications.</p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote"> Maybe I expect too much? </span>
          I can <i>see</i> the effort in these pieces of software, I know that
          the engineers behind them have put time and effort into these things
          to try and create great software (or really really bad software;
          looking at you Apple Notes) to make knowledge management, connections,
          and exploring your thoughts a first-class technology
          <strong>problem</strong>. But it doesn't seem to work for me.

        <h2>So close, yet so disappointing</h2>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            Please don't take this as a glowing review of these things, they
            were terrible, but they got me closer to the feeling I have with
            paper and pen than any of the others have.
          </span>
          Let's talk about the closest i've gotten. Which is an Apple iPad with
          the pro pencil and Apple Notes and FreeForm. This has been the closest
          i've gotten to the feeling that I <i>could</i> get away with a digital
          solution. But the gaps are so wide that my ipad and pencil are
          currently just taking up space and collecting dust on a shelf in my
          bedroom, and have been for months. This past Saturday I thought about
          trading them in for a Steam Deck or a nice fujifilm digital camera I
          saw in town at a second-hand games / electronics store.
        </p>

        <p>Why did I abandon them?</p>

        <p>In one sentence: <strong>terrible software & hardware</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="marginnote">
              The closest real-world approximation is that I once spilt coffee
              on a notebook.
            </span>
            Apple notes would crash at a certain point and a significant volume
            of the notes I had just written would just disappear with no way to
            recover it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat. I would lay my ipad down on my desk, and start to write. The
            bottom right corner of the screen would start to heat up, to the
            point my hand would start to sweat and slip on the glass. I would
            have to postpone what I was thinking through to let the ipad cool
            down before I carried on.
          </li>
          <li>
            The jump between keyboard and pencil is jarring and you still have
            to use the keyboard a lot of the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The text recognition hates me. It forces me into a style of writing
            that isn't comfortable, and makes me focus on the act of writing
            (making sure it recognizes my 'g's) rather than the content of what
            i'm actually writing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apple notes is too simple. You have "sort of" folders, but no way to
            "link" things, or any way to have more customized personalized
            structures of information and content.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Overall, I feel like Apple really dropped the ball hard here. Like
          really hard, almost purposefully. Apple pencil could have been so much
          more if the depth was there on the apps side. The feel of handwriting
          is great, the little helpers for making shapes. Even the selection of
          brushes, pens, sizes, etc... are mint. Care and attention went into
          these, only to have the surrounding software application do all of
          that effort and innovation a massive disservice. I can write, but I
          can't organize and connect any of that writing in meaningful ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apple Notes just feels like the one that I had the highest hopes for,
          that really let me down, probably in no small part because of the cost
          it took to even try it out. It's a lot of money to have to shell out
          when your notepad still feels like a stronger contender than what a
          multi-billion dollar company, focused on hardware and software teams,
          and usability and user experience cranks out.
        </p>

        <p>Apple Notes actually made me <i>feel bad about wanting more</i>.</p>

        <p>
          I don't like that. Which is why this felt more visceral than other
          applications. LogSeq, Roam Research, Obsidian, and all the other i've
          used are really impressive pieces of software, but at the end of the
          day, the physical tactility just isn't there.

        <h2>Physicality</h2>

        <p>
          It helps me collect and process my thoughts. This article was started
          on a legal notepad. Once i'm done, i'll tear out the pages and type it
          up, between me and this pad of paper other than the nib scratching
          across the fibres of the paper there is little friction between my
          brain and the record.
        </p>

        <p>
          My handwritten notes have their own set of problems though. How do you
          impart structure onto something that is for the most part free-form,
          stream of conscience, doodles in the margins, books I want to read,
          notes from articles i've read, work notes, ideas, observations,
          quotes, poems, and random other bits and pieces and bobs that
          collectively account for one hell of a mess?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            <a

              connectivity: a high-density EEG study with implications for the

          </span>
          One of the values in hand-written note taking is reinforcement.
          Writing something down has been scientifically-proven to embed
          learning in your brain much better than typing it out on a keyboard.
          The physical act of jotting something down, summariaizing or doodling
          out how something works exercises parts of your brain that a keyboard
          and mouse just can't.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've used tools like excalidraw, plantuml, visual paradigm, mermaid,
          omnigraffle for <i>decades</i>. Diagrams I create in them I have to
          contually re-reference to refresh my memory as to how the things they
          diagram work.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I start the diagrams on paper, the initial drawings might be
          innacurate, but the important bits are embedded into my memory and I
          have stronger recall for <i>why</i> I made a specific design choice
          than if I had started out diagramming it digitally.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pragmatic among you might at this point be thinking "Jesus H.
          Christ, they're just effing notes, get over it!". I wish I could, but
          it annoys the piss out of me. So for the first time in my 20+ years of
          software engineering and development, i've taken the time out to just
          figure it out. Stop the constant attempts at fitting my brain into
          another engineers mold of what notes ought to be, and going my own way
          (sort of).

        <h2>Where to Start</h2>

        <p>You're gonna laugh. Oh you're gonna laugh.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            I did not follow zettelkasten, but it's worth nothing it's out
            there.
          </span>
          Note cards. Index cards. Zettelkasten if you want the most common
          implementation out there at the moment. Whatever you want to call
          them.That's where this all starts. But we're not following the old
          zettelkasten standard much, if at all. We're going well behond that
          into defining structure across the card index that support how I want
          to think about things, and what topics are important to me at any
          given point in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't want to delve too hard into the zettelkasten culture online,
          because I didn't want other peoples approaches to direct how I wanted
          to do things <i>too much</i>. Similar to things like
          <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" target="_blank"
            >bullet journalling</a
          >
          , there's a lot of attention paid to the
          <u>aesthetic</u> of index card systems to the detriment of actually
          thinking about deep systems and how to design and use them sometimes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Detour: Letting Go</h2>

        <p>
          Committing to paper meant acknowledging something I hadn't really
          thought about in all the time I was trying to get different digital
          solutions to work for me. Changing to the card setup meant letting go
          of something i'd internalized, or made myself responsible for without
          really thinking about the fact i'd done it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core of that was the idea that all this attempt to organize
          information in meaningful ways in a digital structure, was because I
          had a duty of care, a responsibility, and debt to some vague, hazy
          concept of "other people" to make that knowledge available to them.
          That eventually it should be shareable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I egotistically felt that I owed it to the world, or other engineers,
          just someone, to have my thoughts digitized and available for them to
          use or pick apart. Where did this come from? I do not know. I am not a
          particularly active person on social media or even social in real
          life. I'm not a "sharer".
        </p>

        <p>
          The realization that i'd put this unnecessary constraint on myself,
          and the dawning realization that I don't <i>owe</i> any of this
          information to anyone, meant I could rethink what it was I was really
          trying to accomplish, and how I wanted to store and experience
          knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            Cheesy I know, but it does actually help.
          </span>
          I now have a card at the front of my slipbox that just says: "THIS
          BELONGS TO YOU AND NO ONE ELSE. REMEMBER THAT" to remind me of this.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Evolution</h2>

        <p>
          I expect this system to evolve and change over time based on what I
          need it to be at any given time. But at the same time, I don't want it
          to be an amorphous blob of cards in a box (eventually boxes) that
          becomes a burden, and ultimately abandoned. I want things to come out
          of it in constructive ways. Articles, understanding, technical and
          architectural decisions. It has to support a broad spectrum of things
          and goals. That is a
          <i>tall order for any system</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was important to recognize that I was building a system. And that
          dynamism had to be baked into that system from the start. I could
          create lots of distinct, concrete sections and rules about how
          information gets structured into the cards, but that would cause
          friction the moment something didn't align with those predefined
          constraints.
        </p>

        <p>I wanted to avoid friction at all costs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>
          I needed a jumping off point. Zettelkasten was alright, but defining
          zettelkasten, for any individual person is harder. Not to mention that
          alot of content on the internet is about how to do zettelkasten
          digitally.
        </p>

        <p>
          I needed a looser start and I found it in Pirsig. Some of my favourite
          books are the Phaedrus books by Robert M. Pirsig. In Lila
          specifically, Phaedrus describes his note card / index system. This is
          where I started. Phaedrus only describes a little of what his system
          entails, the main sections from a systems perspective. I haven't
          changed alot from the way that it's described in the text, but I
          expect eventually it will.
        </p>

        <p>I started with a few specific dividers:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>UNASSIMILATED</dt>
          <dd>
            Fresh notes, extracted claims, observations, half-formed ideas. New
            things that are ready to be fitted into the system or worked on in
            more detail.
          </dd>
          <dt>PROGRAM</dt>
          <dd>
            Cards to keep track of what i'm doing in the slipbox, tracking
            reworking areas, or things i'm thinking about doing. I like to think
            of these like old-school video game save points.
          </dd>
          <dt>CRIT / GRIT</dt>
          <dd>
            Unfettered frustration & anger. If something isn't working in the
            index, and it's ticking me off it goes in here for me to look at
            later with a clearer head.
          </dd>
          <dt>TOUGH</dt>
          <dd>
            Things that feel important, but i'm not sure where in the wider
            system they should go yet.
          </dd>
          <dt>JUNK</dt>
          <dd>
            Slips that now look bad, duplicates. Kept around because they could
            be reborn into something better later.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          That was my starting point, pretty sparse, but I immediately hit a
          wall. How do I structure information itself? What is important in
          information?
        </p>

        <p>
          Pirsig, through Phaedrus, never tells us what his cards actually look
          like...
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Another digression: Why cards are a good medium</h2>

        <p>
          Cards are small. You might be wondering how can you fit a complex
          thought onto a tiddly little index card? The truth is, that
          complicated thought you had is probably a lot of inter-related things,
          and you'll benefit greatly from trying to sum those things up in as
          few concise words as possible in order to get the salient point
          across. If a detail is important, maybe it needs it's own card.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to be clear, I still use notebooks to explore my thoughts, but
          a card or multiple concise cards going into the slipbox is the
          ultimate goal of that writing, even if it's self-inference or internal
          speculation about feelings and my state of mind.
        </p>

        <p>Back to the slipbox and a bigger question:</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What information is important to me right now?</h2>

        <p>
          To start, there's some basics: things that I want to read, things I
          need to get done, things I have done, and also just as important,
          right now, how do I structure knowledge into a slipbox to make it
          operable?
        </p>

        <p>
          My slipbox could be self-describing. It was going to evolve to be
          self-describing, which is a weird thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I went too deep on that, I added three new sections / dividers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Meaty Bits</h2>

        <p>
          So far we've been kind of dancing around the meat & gristle of how the
          index system works. We've described things that lead to the index, or
          described a bit of the concept of the knowledge system itself or
          things that don't have alot to do with accreting knowledge at all.
          There's a reason for that: it's ridiculously hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first instinct was to start setting up dividers for topics or
          themes of knowledge to organize into. This. Is a trap. A card index on
          the face of it is deep but only in one dimension (the depth of the
          box). You could have sections and subsections but setting up
          pre-conceived notions of sections felt like I was layering constraint
          into the system too early.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I stepped back and asked myself what it was I ultimately wanted to
          do? What did I want to get out of this?
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A reference that I can reach for and quickly find and review
            information or jog my memory about how something works.
          </li>
          <li>
            A way to ingest and structure information, ideas, content,
            philosophy, feeling and the world around me.
          </li>
          <li>
            A way to link and relate what i've learned and find new connections
            between disparate things.
          </li>
          <li>
            A way to explore the knowledge and bring things together into
            articles, technical decisions or plans.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These are some pretty lofty goals for a bunch of lined paper. A lot of
          pressure on the card index out the gate, but I was on a week off at
          this point, I had time. I could do this.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Some new dividers</h2>

        <p>
          I added a new divider to my slipbox. All it says is "CLUSTERS", and I
          threw out the dividers i'd started to create around specific topics
          and themes and added one other new type of card within a new divider.
        </p>

        <h3>DOMAINS</h3>
        <p>
          These are individual cards that have an overarching domain concept.
          Something fairly general like "philosophy", or "management", and
          "Learning".
        </p>

        <p>
          On each thematic card, I list clusters that belong under that theme.
          This gives me a higher-level organisation, without it having to be
          represented by the structure of the slipbox dividers itself.
        </p>

        <h3>CLUSTERS</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="static/img/clusters.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          I want my slipbox to be <i>alive</i> or at least to feel alive. I've
          been working on developing an upper ontology system at my day job.
          Using RDF/Turtle and the OWL spec with some bits and pieces of the
          SKOS spec peppered in.
        </p>
        <p>
          At work, I define a concept of a "Domain" and inside that we have
          DirectClasses, with Attributes, Relationships, Enumerations, and more.
          That is far too structured for what I want to do. But it shows that I
          had to shake off a desire to organize things
          <strong>too</strong> systematically when thinking about how I organize
          my own knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I wanted was a way to group things together in <i>some way</i>. I
          landed on "systems". My whole life is a delicate interplay of many
          different systems, that sounds slightly reductionist to life in
          general, but I like thinking in systems. It helps me to reason about
          them and understand my experiences of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my entire slipbox <i>is a system</i>, the finer details of which
          <i>describe other systems</i> through clusters, which are cumulatively
          a reflection of
          <i>my understanding of how these systems interconnect on the whole</i
          >. My wife won't like that approach if I put relationship things in
          there, but dammit, this is mine, she can make her own damn system,
          based around cats or something.
        </p>

        <p>
          So when do cards form a cluster? Whenever really. If you've got enough
          cards that work together, and you can describe that working together
          fairly succinctly like: "Pluralism in systems of governance", or
          "operational stability & drift" then you've got a cluster. Clusters
          can break apart, merge, dissolve as they change and new connections
          are formed and more information becomes available.
        </p>

        <p>
          They're loose groupings that help to organize the thoughts, not
          buckets to put things into discretely.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Where are we going with this?</h2>

        <p>
          So now I have the high-level structure of my slipbox. I've got
          clusters which represent systems of thought, and I have domain cards
          which group these clusters together under higher-level themes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is all getting very philosophical, but what is a card? What goes
          on the cards? How do I maintain some level of coherence? And how do we
          relate these cards?
        </p>

        <p>We come back to the question of what it is that I really want.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            I want to understand <strong>concepts</strong> and what they are
          </li>
          <li>I want to understand <strong>how they work</strong></li>
          <li>
            I want to understand the <strong>tensions</strong> and
            <strong>rules</strong> that govern them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to <strong>differentiate</strong> them from each other.
          </li>
          <li>I want to understand how things <strong>break</strong></li>
          <li>
            ...and I want to know how all these things
            <strong>relate to each other</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I could come up with some card types pretty quickly off the back of
          that.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>TENSION CARD</dt>
          <dd>
            <span class="marginnote">
              <img src="static/img/card-tension.png" />
            </span>
            Describes two forces in opposition of each other. These are things
            like "stability vs. change". They're fairly generic, and I can try
            and whittle them down to their core so a tension can exist on its
            own, independent of a cluster, and form a link between more than one
            concept in a cluster or across clusters.
          </dd>
          <dt>MECHANISM CARD</dt>
          <dd>
            These describe the step-by-step of how an outcome is arrived at. If
            for instance we're talking about "Vendor Lock-in" as a concept, a
            mechanism of that could be: "Skill specialization around vendor
            tools creates vendor-lockin".
          </dd>
          <dt>PRINCIPLE CARD</dt>
          <dd>
            Principle cards are pretty rare so far. I've frontloaded a few into
            the slipbox, but they're such wide reacihing things that can touch
            many concepts, so I created a dedicated section for them. These are
            cards like "Conway's Law", or "Postel's Law". Cards in the cluster
            link to the principle cards they are governed by.
          </dd>
          <dt>DISTINCTION CARDS</dt>
          <dd>
            <span class="marginnote">
              I have always struggled with dates and time.
            </span>
            These tell me how something is different from another thing. Which
            is just as important as knowing how things are similar. For example,
            I have a cluster "Temporal Representation & Correction". In it I
            have a card that says "Leap Day != Leap Year" that lays out the
            fundamental differences between these two things to help me reason
            about them.
          </dd>
          <dt>FAILURE MODE CARDS</dt>
          <dd>
            I <strong>love</strong> these cards. They're like my guilty little
            pleasure. These describe how stuff breaks and falls apart. What goes
            wrong that brings the whole house tumbling down. If all the other
            cards in the slipbox are character development, these cards are the
            harrowing experiences those characters go through in pursuit of
            their goals. I absolutely love writing these cards.

        <h2>Digression: This could be a whole lot more OTT</h2>

        <p>
          We'll get to the root of it all, the concept card, in a moment, but I
          want to specifically call out that I could have gone way overboard
          here with the card types, and I almost did.
        </p>

        <p>
          I could have had trade-offs, hypothesis, claims, observations,
          heuristics, examples, counter-example cards, and on and on. Right up
          until I had some crazy ontology. But this needs to be
          <i>maintainable</i>. I don't want to spend loads of time and effort
          trying to figure out what kind of tidbit of information a card is, and
          I need to feel like I can step out of that structuring without slowing
          thought when I need to.

        <h2>Concept Cards: The Beating Heart</h2>

        <figure>
          <img src="static/img/concep-card.jpg" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          Let's get onto the concept cards, then we'll talk about relationships
          and some other glue-y bits after.
        </p>

        <p>
          What in the hell constitutes a concept? Amiright? In my slipbox?
          Anything. Anything I can describe with some detail and is important to
          me in the moment or long-term.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote"> I know what a Giraffe is.<br /> </span>
          The constraint i've set myself though is that I <i>need</i> to frame
          the concept in the context of the system. I <i>do not want</i> a bunch
          of definition cards. Having a card that tells me there's a thing
          called "Giraffe" and that it's "yellow with a long neck" doesn't
          provide me with a whole lot of anything to work with longer-term.
        </p>

        <p>
          "A large browsing herbivore adapted to feed on high vegetation through
          extreme neck elongation and height advantage" tells me how a Giraffe
          operates, interacts, and integrates with other things which could form
          a cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote"> We should all have good boundaries. </span>
          A concept could be a person, a place, thing, process, a system in and
          of itself, it could be just an <i>idea</i>. If i'm working out a
          concept within a cluster, I try to define what it
          <i>means in the context of that system</i>, its structural role, and
          the boundary of that thing. We're describing its role in the system,
          not its dictionary definition, and we're describing when it ceases to
          be itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          A "Giraffe" isn't just its colour and pattern, its the traits and its
          function within the system that define it. These qualities are the
          important aspects, not the superficial identification mechanisms. I
          can remember what a Giraffe looks like, I don't need to re-identify
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not holding myself hard to this. They are guidelines intended to
          help me summarize a concept in concrete terms. But a concept card
          really could be anything, and equally important is that concepts can
          have
          <strong>relationships</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Relationships</h2>

        <p>
          These are hard. All relationships are hard. They're emotional,
          complicated, and can be strong, or hazy, and ill-defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few different ways that I can define relationships in the
          slipbox. Each of them serving different purposes:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Cluster Relationships</dt>
          <dd>
            A card simply exists in a cluster. It's existence there implies it
            has meaning in association with all the other cards in that cluster.
            If it doesn't, it should probably get moved where it does, or into
            JUNK, TOUGH, CRIT/GRIT depending on how I feel about that card.
          </dd>
          <dt>Direct Relationships</dt>
          <dd>
            A mechanism card could relate directly to a specific concept card or
            vice-versa, or a failure mode could be relatively simple in that it
            has a direct correlation to a specific principle, tension, concept
            or all three.
          </dd>
          <dt>RELATIONSHIP CARDS</dt>
          <dd>
            This is where things get <i>interesting</i>. Remember I said earlier
            i've been working on ontology systems? Well those naturally
            gravitate towards graph systems and graphs have EDGES which are
            usually a defined <strong>type</strong> of relationship.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          <strong>Relationship cards</strong> don't just tell you a relationship
          exists, they <i>qualify</i> that relationship and explain the linkage.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll give you a concrete example from the slipbox. I have a concept
          called "Perceived Self-Interest Discounting" in a cluster called
          "Vendorization Dynamics". I then have a FAILURE MODE card titled "Risk
          Blindness Through Motive Discounting".
        </p>
        <p>
          In my cluster, the first card has a
          <strong>causal</strong> relationship to the second. The concept
          described by the card <strong>causes</strong> the failure mode. The
          relationship card itself states that outright as the relationship
          type, and elaborates with a little blurb.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Motive discounting shifts motivation from "risk model" to
            "politics", which favours vendor narratives and hides long-term
            dependency cost.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <i>Mechanics</i> are how concepts operate, <i>relationships</i> are
          how the whole system operates. I have a divider for relationships
          specifically because they can cross the bounds of clusters:
          vendorization cards could form relationships over into my
          socio-technical cluster for instance. Not all relations are in that
          dedicated section, some live in the clusters for various reasons. But
          I put a lot of faith in the relationship cards on the whole to lead me
          through the slipbox.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is all probably sounding fairly intense at this point. It felt
          pretty intense thinking through it. Putting in the kitchen sink, then
          gradually clawing back and refining it into something maintainable.
          It's a balancing act, and I can say with 100% certainty that this
          isn't its final form. There's a bigger question though, and a few more
          sections and cards to still flesh out. Deeper down the rabbit hold we
          go.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>

        <p>
          You might already have a question in your head: how do you use this to
          actually <strong>do something</strong>? Same question I asked myself.
          It's a tricky one. And it led to some more evolution, with some new
          sections and card types, mostly focused on getting information
          <i>into</i> and <i>out of</i> the slipbox.
        </p>

        <h3>PROJECT CARDS</h3>

        <p>
          This is the seed of an output. Chasing better understanding of a
          concept, technical decision drivers, or an article, maybe eventually a
          book. It goes into a "PROJECTS" divider and each project has a core
          thesis; the thing i'm trying to write about or the decision i'm trying
          to arrive at, or the system i'm trying to understand.
        </p>

        <p>The project card lists the questions that I want to answer, like:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Why do note systems fail?</li>
          <li>What makes knowledge retrievable?</li>
          <li>What is structure vs. storage?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The project card then links to a <strong>MAP</strong>, but the project
          card itself is all about declaring and recording
          <strong>intent</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>MAP CARDS</h3>

        <p>
          The MAP cards are exactly what they say on the tin. It's a card (or
          cards depending on the scale) that points to all the different cards
          across the slipbox that are pertinent to the project card.
        </p>

        <p>
          These could span multiple clusters, and other areas, but it acts as
          the index of the research that drives towards answering the questions
          laid out in the project and thesis.
        </p>

            A large part of all of this is finding small maintenance activities,
            that don't overburden, but provide a large benefit overall.
          </span>
          To make life easier in general, I created "cluster hub cards" for some
          of the larger clusters. These act as small indices, so that rather
          than having to root through the whole cluster, I can pull the hub card
          to see if what I am looking for is in there. It isn't a huge change,
          but it is a <i>quality of life</i> change to make it easier to work in
          the bounds of the slipbox.

        <h2>Tying it all together</h2>

        <p>
          A project card defines a desired output (article, decision,
          understanding) which has an evolving map (links to cards) which drives
          the result of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          If all the cards are lined up and you have enough information in the
          slipbox, then the answer just sort of
          <i>falls out the end of the process</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of an article, you pull the cards from your map, and lay
          them out to form the backbone of the outline of the article you're
          trying to write. If it's a technical decision, you have the necessary
          info to record an architectural decision record, including describing
          what the trade-offs of the decision are.
        </p>

        <p>
          "But what if there aren't enough, or any cards to support the project"
          I hear you ask. I went well beyond what I should have, I had a whole
          week to think through all this.

        <h2>Feeding the beast</h2>

        <p>
          I was originally going to go into a lot more detail about the pipeline
          leading from sources into the slipbox itself, but I want this article
          to more or less stand on it's own in describing the initial version of
          the slipbox system itself rather than the processes around it.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I will say for now, is that I have a
          <strong>SOURCES</strong> divider. This is where I put information
          about what i've researched or want to research. It's my references
          section in a final article for instance. If it's an important source,
          like a paper, I link the subsequent concepts to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's simple enough, but <i>how</i> do we go from an article, book,
          or paper to the structures that I've described?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marginnote">
            Heavy emphasis on the "for me" part here. YMMV.
          </span>
          The answer is, it's tricky, and it's probably intensely personal. The
          source could be tricky to interpret, but also, we all interpret things
          differently. I've sort of bastardized a number of different approaches
          into something that's currently working form, but i'll create a
          separate article to describe that. It's worth saying though, that it's
          very tailored for me, and my slipbox design.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, in my experience though, a good article source should net you
          numbers sort of like the below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>3-10 Concept Cards</li>
          <li>2-5 Relationship cards</li>
          <li>1-3 Mechanism cards</li>
          <li>1-3 Distinctions</li>
          <li>1-3 Failure modes</li>
          <li>0-1 Principles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Principles are like super rare pokemon, they come up rarely, and a lot
          of times they're implied rather than being outright declared.
        </p>

        <h2>I'm just trying</h2>

        <p>
          Look i'm not saying this system is perfect, far from it. I wanted
          something better, that supported how I want to work through things and
          I feel like i'm <strong>on my way there</strong>. I've not yet
          arrived, and the feedback loop feels better than anything i've used in
          the past. The physicality of it I think is at least part of the key.
          The triggering of my brains connections feels empowering.
        </p>

        <p>
          With software note systems, you're continually working within the
          bounds of the engineers interpretation of how things could work. When
          you start to reach the boundaries or edges of that system, the places
          where the engineer or developer hasn't really gone yet, you start to
          hit walls, things break or don't quite work right, and you make
          concessions and compromises in how you attack the problem. I don't
          have that problem in the slipbox, the only limits are really the ones
          that i've artificially imposed on myself in order to keep things
          maintainable, but those can change and evolve over time
          <strong>based on my needs</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I get new, different indicators for where I need to put effort.
          The size of a cluster in a slipbox is a good proxy for how much I know
          about that topic. A thin & reedy cluster either means I need to do
          more research or I need to rethink that clusters existence overall.
        </p>

        <h2>Identification Systems</h2>

        <p>
          I've purposely danced around this up until now, because even though
          it's important, it's not the most important piece of the system.
          Plenty of articles get really hung up on how you ID things, and a lot
          of them rely on software. UUIDs, Timestamps, etc... are all great, but
          I can't compute and track UUIDs in my head. Maybe other people can.
        </p>

        <p>Again, I asked myself what I really wanted the ID system to do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It should have a <i>sense</i> of time</li>
          <li>It should be extremely simple to write but unique</li>
          <li>It needs to represent threads of thought during a day</li>
          <li>
            And it needs to represent ordering of those thoughts in a given
            thread
          </li>
          <li>It needs to help me find things relatively quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That's a pretty tall order for an ID system. So I researched
          alternative calendar systems, because i'm lazy and I don't want to
          record "Thurs, Jan 26th, 2026 22:00" on every card. Cards are small, I
          want the important thing to be the title, not the ID.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I arrived at was a bastardization of the Arvelie calendar system.
        </p>

        <p>
          So in my relationships, tensions, principles, they just get
          incrementing IDs. This turned out a little unwieldy for relationship
          cards, but i'm actively working out how to deal with that still.
        </p>
        <p>
          So simply "P-001", "P-002", "T-010" for these rarer cards, so they
          have a strong indicator as where in the slipbox dividers they exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next were the clusters themselves, again, these are kept intentionally
          simple. My cluster on "Metaphysics of Quality" is just "C-MOQ" written
          in pencil so that I can rub it out and reuse the divider if the
          cluster dissolves into something else. Crucially, I don't put the
          cluster ids on the cards inside them.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the cards themselves, I used the Arvelie date system for each card
          and prefixes and suffixes that give that card more dimensionality, and
          metadata about the type, and local relationship around the moment that
          I created the cards.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Arvelie calendar system i'll leave up to you to read up on. The
          core point is that it's compact (00A00 is Jan 1st 2026) and uses an
          anchor year (in this case 2026). I prefix that with a card type
          indicator (so C-00A00 is a concept card) which helps me narrow the
          what i'm looking for when searching for it from a map, or
          relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          When i'm interpreting an article, or plotting out a thought across
          cards, I can have multiple tracks of thought throughout a day. I use a
          letter suffix to denote that i've started a train (e.g. C-00A00-A),
          and a further incrementing number to denote order within that thinking
          (e.g. C-00A00-A-05).
        </p>

        <figure class="fullwidth">
          <img src="static/img/arvelie-id.png" />
        </figure>

        <p>
          All that results in a fairly meaningful id that packs a lot of
          information and helps me rediscover thought pathways and gives me a
          quick sense of time elapsed, and time locality for when I wrote that
          card.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Shifting relationships</h2>

        <p>
          Earlier I said that I moved cards for relationships out into their own
          divider. I'm still on the fence about this if i'm being honest and I'm
          waiting get a feel of how it works once the slipbox is much larger.
        </p>

        <p>
          The crux of it is that I want to traverse the relationships in the
          slipbox at times, and I need a separation there in case cards move
          from cluster to cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my relationship cards reference the full Arvelie dates + an
          indicator which cluster those cards exist in. If they're cluster cards
          I make strong point of writing these in pencil. Having to update these
          means I get the opportunity to reivew them and see if the
          relationships still hold, and sometimes it triggers additional
          linkages or ideas of exploration that I can put in as new cards or
          seed project cards to research something in more depth.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>More boxes</h2>

        <p>
          At the moment, my slipbox has around 1,000 cards in it and it's
          growing by the week. The continual refinement approach i'm taking
          means sometimes I can be lazy, sometimes i'm not feeling plumbing the
          depths of some topic, so I bang out a card and shove it into the
          unassimilated section for future me to discover and see if I have the
          need to expand it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If i'm learning a new code concept, I dive in, try it out, work
          examples, and apply it in domains I have deep understanding in.
          Through the attempts and failures I get a better understanding of the
          coding practice, tool, or framework, it's limits, use cases, operating
          modes and how it comes apart at the seams.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't have a way to do that same process for non-programming tasks,
          and i'm sad I didn't relaize that sooner in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          This slipbox system, as well laid out as I have made it, will change.
          It will evolve to align more and more with what aspects of "things" I
          find important. I'm looking forward to that, the hard part right now
          is time. Finding time in a busy, often chaotic family and work life to
          sit down and think deeply through the slipbox as a tool for thought
          and exploration. But when I do make timeI feel a larger sense of
          accomplishment than I have ever felt typing things into the ether.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll write more about the process of getting information into the
          slipbox in a subsequent article. For now i'm trying to get settled
          into using this thing, and steering it and finding evolutions of it
          that make it more powerful, as well as getting to grips with the
          concepts of maintenance that it requires.
