      <h1>Wellcome UDA</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Jeff Uren ★ 2026-02-26</p>
      <p>
        We have a weird problem at Wellcome. We have
        <strong>too much</strong> data.
      </p>

      <section>
        <p>
          It's sprawling: Wellcome has a wide remit across a large number of
          domains and undertakings that cross a lot of themes. Contrasted with a
          product-oriented company, Wellcomes remit can feel frenetic and crazy
          at times when you're trying to reconcile between different sources and
          systems at play external, and internal to the organisation.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have integrations, machine learning activities, "soft" processes
          that revolve around spreadsheets, and more that all need
          reconciliation.
        </p>

        <p>
          With our remit spanning all the domains that we fund, investments,
          finance, people management, portfolio management, and more.
          <strong>Meaning</strong> can get lost, muddied or confused across
          different teams and departments, and even between two people in the
          same team.

        <h2>The Lead-In</h2>

        <p>
          We've just come off of a good stretch of work to migrate our data
          pipelines and infrastructure from a closed proprietary set of
          platforms to something more modern and flexible. It's reduced our
          overall cost massively in terms of licensing costs, and opened up
          access to a lot more flexibility around using the appropriate tools
          for any given situation and the ability to scale workloads in multiple
          directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this while remaining maintainable for a small, very talented
          team of software engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've made huge strides in bringing greater volumes of data, and
          bringing new technical capabilities to our engineering team. That
          included building custom tooling like our teams `ops-tool` that
          smooths over some of the warts of setup and teardown of airflow
          development environments with strong controls around access to data.
        </p>

        <p>
          And we've made huge reductions in time to deliver data, and controls
          and cost around that data. But we still have more to do around
          performance improvements, governance controls, and all the other bits
          that float around a modern data infrastructure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Old Problems, Meet New Problems</h2>
        <p>
          We've seen significant speed-ups in our teams delivery speed, and more
          room to focus on the hard problems. But that hasn't necessarily
          translated up to teams that rely on the outputs of our team. Warehouse
          tables, data products, integrations and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          So we need to shift some of our internal focus, outwards, to create
          tools, systems, and primitives that support Insights & Analytics
          Teams, ML Engineers, Data Owners, Governance functions, and ultimately
          the whole org itself to make sure that we can unlock the same speed
          ups and agility we've unlocked for ourselves, for everyone else.
        </p>

        <p>Doing anything otherwise would be self-defeating.</p>

        <h2>Enter Semantic Data</h2>
        <p>
          Modern data systems (data lakes, parquet files, iceberg, streaming
          systems, worker-based parallelism) can end up sprawling really easily.
          We have structures in place to guard against that, but for a long
          time, governance consisted of documenting our controls with little
          insight into the actual inner-workings of how we apply and manage it
          for people like Data Owners.
        </p>

        <p>
          Semantic Data has opened up a whole world of possibilities on that
          front that currently require a lot of duct tape. As an smart, highly
          technical team this is how we plan to tackle it all.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Unified Data Architecture (UDA)</h2>

        <p>
          This is not an <strong>enterprise data model</strong>. What we're
          doing isn't modelling the data across all the systems and sources that
          are at play in the organisation. That generally is a bit of a fools
          errand where you're in a constant cycle of updates to the model to
          keep up with change in the upstream systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the purposes here, we don't particularly care how data is modeled
          and managed in the systems upstream from us.
