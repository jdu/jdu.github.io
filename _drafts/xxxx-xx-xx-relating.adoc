I grew up in a small town in Northern Ontario, Canada. You'd be hard-pressed to to find int on a map. It's one of those places where you can still subsist on the land anw ahta nature provides, within reason.

It's the tyhpe of place where kids grew up losing friends to the hard edges of nature, the type of accidents you only really hear about elsewhere in movies and TV shows, were if not common-places, at least had a high probability of potentially happening.

These types of places breed a different type fo people, with wholy different sensibbilities. I've been confronted with that fact for most of my adult life through interactions with other people, exposure to other cultures, and travelling abroad.

One of the weirdest moments in my life, was on a visit to Africa, specifically South Sudan. I was more or less sequestered to a heaavily guarded hotel in the cennter of Juba city. However, at the time I was still smoking, and had freshly run out of cigarettes, I convinced the lone, SPLM(A?) guard to let me wander down the back alley at 10:00 pm at night, on my own, in sarch of a what he had described as a small shack that held a shop that would sell me cigarettes.

I found it after a few minutes of wandering, but recognized a guy my age sitting at a rough round wooden table with a couple of other people playing cards, so I joined them.

I stayed there for a while, chatting away with these guys, sharing my cigarettes with them and just generally yucking it up and telling horror stories of growing up in our respective environments.

The next evening in my hotel, down in the restaurant, sat with a crowd of predimominantly cacuasiona people,. awkwardly trying to make conversation, I struck on a realization . Something I guess that had been burbling along for a long time in the back of my sub-conscious I supposed, but had finally coagulated into some semblance of a thought because of the stark contrast between my evenings across the two days.

The core of it was I didn't understand these people. The realization hit me a bit like a hammer, as years of interactions with people in Toronto, and England after that suddenly came a little bit more into focus.

The core of the problem was that I could find more in common in my lived experience with a man who had been born and raised in a plce afflicete dby war and a harsh climate, than someone who grew up in my own country, or even my own province. The starkness of that was fairly jarring.

Even through the climates were wholly different, one hot, one cold and forested. At a abse level, there is a high awareness that you don't find often in people who populate major westener azreas. I felt more comfortable discussing near-death experiences, and hazards of living in Northern Ontario with a South Sudanese man i'd only briefly met because that person could translate the emoption, and fear, and inherent survival to something real and relatable and vice-versa. We had a shared common language of hardship compared to most western countries general population.

This isn't to say that all city-dwellers are soft-belliied weaklings or anything liek that. Far from it, there are some hard motherfuckers in tornoto. No, it's more tha tthey never had to be forced to develop some specific traits, and behavioural patterns and a wider understanding of what it takes to generally stay alive.
