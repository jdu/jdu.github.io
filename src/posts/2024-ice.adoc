I grew up in a small town in Northern Ontario, Canada. You'd be hard-pressed to find it on a map. It's one of those places where you can still subsist on the land (to an extent) and what nature provides, within reason.

It's the type of place where kids grew up losing friends to the hard edges of nature, the type of accidents you only really hear about in movies and TV shows, enough so that it's common-place that you've lost someone you knew or heard of on more than one occasion through growing up in such a place.

These types of places breed a different type of people, with wholly different sensibilities. I've been confronted with that fact for most of my adult life through interactions with other people, exposure to other cultures, and travelling abroad.

Below is a recounting of one of many times that not taking that seriously enough nearly cost me my life. Sometimes no matter how careful you are, it's unavoidable, if you're extra careful in those situations you might get away light by losing a digit, garnering some nice scars, or being hospitalized for a little while.

When I was around 15 years old I fell through the ice, it was late at night, overcast, and one of the fastest ways to get to and from town in the dead of Winter was to use your snowmobile to ride across the frozen lakes and trails to get wherever it was that you were heading. On this specific night, I was heading home from the movies and a bit of a late night in a coffee shop, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee with friends. By the time I left to go home, it was dark, overcast, and I was losing the light very rapidly. By the time I hit the lakes I had lost what little light had been left to me and I found myself without bearings deep in the Northern Ontario wilderness.

Panic hadn't kicked in yet, or maybe it had and I just refused to accept it. I had been riding for about a half hour and had clearly taken a wrong turn somewhere, I was on the lakes, but there were no lights on the shores, there were no docks or clearly lit windows of houses along the shoreline as far as I could see. The softly drifting snow, like rain, forms layers and layers of haze that play tricks on the eyes in the dark as your eyes fight to focus on the far off distance but are continually dragged back to the sheets of falling snow in the beam of your headlight.

In order to try and get a bit of a better idea of where I was, to try and find some bearings, some landmark that I could recognize, whether it was the bend of a turn in the lake, a point I had passed many times before, an island, anything, I stopped my snow machine, turned off the lights and walked out away from it. The main idea being that my eyes were struggling because of the light from the headlights on the machine, so if I stepped away and let my eyes adjust I might just be able to make something out that I recognize through the murky white soup that was fogging my vision.

It was just as my pupils were adjusting that I went straight through the ice.

If you've ever lived anywhere cold like Northern Ontario, you know you can dress for minus 30, you can generally be pretty comfortable if you pay attention to appropriate layering, covering exposed skin, etc...

All those layers, sopping wet in near frozen water are a whole different story, and in some cases, a quick way to meet your maker.

As I was falling I had managed to twist just enough to catch my arm on the lip of the hole I had created when I plunged down. The last ditch move hadn't saved me from a thorough dunking, but it had kept me from going under and getting stuck under the ice, or sinking like a lead balloon. I couldn't feel the bottom of the lake.

I managed to slowly drag myself up onto the ice from out of the hole, the heavy leathers I was wearing weighed as much as a whole other person. I was trying to remain calm, hoping that the ice I was worming my way out onto and across wouldn't give way under me, if the water was deep underneath me it would have taken a lot more effort to get to the surface without the leverage of a solid edge.

A few feet away from the hole I gambled on making it to my snow machine, limping along in my slush-filled, fast-freezing gear. I could hear the leathers around my knees and arms cracking as the water turned to ice in the cold air and my movement broke some of it free. My hand landed on the bar across the back of the track of the snow-machine, thankfully still running and I hauled the backend of the snow-machine 90 degrees to point it away from where I had fallen through, hopped on, and gunned it to get away from there as quickly as possible.

My entire tact changed from "get home" to "get anywhere" in the span of less than a minute. My eyes scanned the horizon for any sign of a house-light, any sign of a road, an opening in the tree-line that might be hiding a house set back from the shoreline that I could find safety in, but there was nothing. To keep myself going I was letting off a stream of swear words into the inside of my helmet but it wasn't enough to distract me from the fact my feet were starting to lose sensation, and the crawl from the cold sting of wet socks to a dull numb-ness in my feet and legs was causing me to start to panic.

The moment I saw the vague far off incandescent light I nearly lost my mind. The cold was working its way up my legs, and my teeth were chattering uncontrollably in my head, my jaw was in pain from trying to dampen the chattering, and it felt like someone had wound my jaw with rubber bands in every direction for all the good it did me trying to get keep my teeth from rattling out of my head.

I made it to shore, drove straight up to the door that the light sat above, and hammered on the door. I was in tears, everything hurt, it had been almost an hour since I had fallen through the ice. I was mentally preparing myself to break into the house if no one answered when the door swung open and light flooded out onto the patch of packed driveway snow I was occupying. I can't even imagine what I looked like.

All I could muster to say through my chattering teeth was something along the lines of "I fell through, I can't feel my feet". I'm not even sure what I think I said actually came out as anything more than a muffled, chattering noise.

My memory is pretty hazy after that point, once I had made it through the door my body must have swapped out the last reserves of adrenaline I had been running on for an acute case of shock.

My dad picked me up in his Silverado, but I don't remember how long it was before he got there. There must have been a considerable amount of time, but it's all more or less gone in my brain, or never registered in the first place. There's a part of me that remembers him being upset, but I don't remember words, nor do I remember the car journey home, or how long it took. I didn't even know whose house I had actually ended up at.

To this day I still have periodic nightmares about standing in the middle of a frozen lake, the only thing I can see, the hazy outline of the tips of the pines off in the distance along the edge of where they meet the dark night sky. Everything else is black. The only sound, the crunching of the snow under my boots and the dull echoes and crackles of ice settling and shifting under my feet. Paralyzed with fear, and scared to run in any direction in case I fall through, I stand stock still, hoping for the moon, or stars to break out of the clouds and give me a path shore.

I'll close by saying that I feel an immense amount of guilt for what that experience must have been for my parents. Living in Northern Ontario or any remote Northern Community in Canada comes with a marked acceptance that these things *could* and *will* happen, and if you live your life without a hefty amount of respect for the surrounding wilderness, they're likely to happen sooner rather than later. In a lot of cases though, it's unfortunately inevitable.

I was far from the first to go through the ice, but I was one of the lucky ones that didn't lose their lives because of it.

Unfortunately, the home that I had ended up at that night, they hadn't been so lucky with their own son years before.

Here I was standing on their doorstep in the middle of the night, drenched and frozen, in pretty bad shape, like a ghost out of time. I feel an unending well of guilt for the horror of emotions they must have had to relive because of my carelessness. My poor decision to leave it so late getting home. I'll forever be indebted to them, least of which for leaving that porch light on. They took me in, gave me dry clothes, called my parents and probably more I don't even realize and can't remember. There's not much else I could possibly say really that would explain how much gratitude I feel to those people, and how bad I feel for what I must have inflicted on them.

My dad went back for the snow machine the next day, and he tried to find where I had gone through, but he couldn't find a trace of where I'd been or where I had come from, or how I had strayed so far from the trail home. The falling snow had covered over my tracks, and if my father couldn't find it in broad daylight, if I hadn't had caught my arm, it's likely they wouldn't have found whatever was left of me until the next Spring.
