= Reading

== Permanent Bookshelf

The books here are more or less permanent fixtures on my bookshelf. They're books i'll go back and read extracts, or the entirety all over again at some point throughout a year.

In most cases it's because something about the books feeds into the way I think, or feel, or operate, or contain something important to me. All of these books I would recommend others reading, but with a healthy recognition that these choices are intensely personal ones and you may not feel the same way about them as I do.
