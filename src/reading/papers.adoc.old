= Papers :eye: :heart:

This is a collection of different papers, from a variety of sources, that I have read and really appreciated or liked over the year. Some of these are in domains that a re far removed from where I am at the moment, and a fair few I may not even be able to 100% grasp at this point in my career still. But overall they've been interesting or had to deal with something that I have a keen interest in.
