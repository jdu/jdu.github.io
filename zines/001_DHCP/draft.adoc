Wellcome!

This is the first of a few "`zines" that i've produced to help describe low to moerately complex concepts, tools and systems in software and computer systems.

The point is to make concise, straight-to-the-point information readily available for people to understand a given concept in a bite-sized package.

These 'zines are small intentionally, they're also stupidly cheap to print if you want to own a physical copy.

All the 'zines are available as EPub, PDF, and a variety of other formats so you can drop it onto whatever device you read on. They're also DRM-free which means you can pass them around without me lookin' over your shoulder. I mean, I like money, but I like people knowing things more.
